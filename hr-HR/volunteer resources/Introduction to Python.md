Python is a widely used, general purpose, text-based programming language.

### Using Trinket

When completing our HTML & CSS projects, we recommend using [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) to build webpages online. Trinket offers several advantages over writing code offline:

+ Children can see a live preview of their HTML & CSS code;
+ Children can save their code online, allowing them to access their webpages both within their club and at home;
+ Children can share their webpages with others, and can remix webpages shared with them.

The first Python project (called [About Me](http://jumpto.cc/about-me)) explains the creating, saving and viewing of a simple webpage in more detail.

### Working offline

When working offline, we recommend downloading and using version 3.2 of Python, which can be found at [jumpto.cc/python-offline](http://jumpto.cc/python-offline).

Installing Python will also install the IDLE Python editor, which is the simplest way of writing and running Python programs. IDLE consists of 2 windows, the editor (where programs are written) and the ‘Shell’ (where programs are run).

When IDLE is run, you will probably see the Python Shell window. You can open a new editor window by clicking ‘File → New Window’. Once you have written your program, you should save it (remembering to add .py to the end of your filename). You can then run your Python program by clicking ‘Run → Run Module’ (or by pressing F5).

Alternatively, .py files can be created and edited using any text editor e.g. Notepad on Windows, Textedit on MacOS, or Leafpad on Raspbian (Raspberry Pi). These files can also be run from a command line interface or terminal by typing `python3` followed by the Python filename e.g. `python3 hello_world.py`. On Windows you would type `py -3 hello_world.py` instead.

As Python is text-based, children may make typing mistakes (called syntax errors), which may prevent them from running a program. The ‘Notes for Club Leader’ that accompany each Python project gives guidance on common syntax errors, along with information on how they can be avoided.
